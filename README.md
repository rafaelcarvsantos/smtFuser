# SMT Fuser

## Description

A tool to help Shin Megami Tensei Strange Journey Redux players fuse more than two demons at once.

There are plenty of great fusion tools already on the web but none of them allow you to fuse multiple demons easily and filter through all the results without having to click too much.

## Features

Multiple demons fusion

Autocomplete demon names

Fuse back result demons with original demons, with a depth of up to three times

Easily see all skills and relevant status of result demons

Easily filter through the results


## Usage

Simply execute smt.exe and then type all the demons' names you want to fuse. Choose the depth of the fusion process: 'one' means just the direct fusions; 'two' means the direct fusions and also their results fused back with the original demons; 'three' means the same as two, but also fusing back those new demons with the originals. You can also choose the related Subapps, add more demons or clear all the name inputs at once.
